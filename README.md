# üìà Stock Price Prediction with GenAI Insights

Predict and explain stock market trends by combining time-series forecasting (Prophet + LSTM) with market sentiment, economic indicators, and the power of generative AI using Groq + LLaMA 3.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Collect real-time stock and economic data
- Engineer predictive features from financial indicators and sentiment
- Forecast future stock prices using both Prophet and deep learning (LSTM via Darts)
- Backtest and evaluate model performance
- Use Groq + LLaMA 3 to **explain predictions in plain language**

## üß† Why This Project?

Forecasting stock prices isn‚Äôt just about numbers ‚Äî it's about **understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind predictions**. By using Generative AI, we give data scientists and investors an intelligent assistant that makes models easier to trust, interpret, and refine.

How It Works

‚û§ Data Collection
- Pulls stock data via yfinance
- Fetches economic indicators (CPI, interest rates, unemployment) from FRED
- Uses Hugging Face transformers to analyze market sentiment from headlines

‚û§ Feature Engineering
- Calculates returns, rolling volatility
- Merges sentiment and macroeconomic context into a single dataset

‚û§ Forecasting
- Prophet: interpretable time-series predictions
- Darts LSTM: advanced deep learning forecasting with multivariate inputs

‚û§ Evaluation
- Calculates MAE (Prophet) and MAPE (Darts)
- Uses backtesting to simulate real-world performance

‚û§ Generative AI Insights
- Converts last 10 days of data into text-based summaries
- Embeds them using HuggingFaceEmbedding
- Uses LlamaIndex + Groq (LLaMA 3) to answer questions like:
`‚ÄúWhy did the model predict a drop in Apple‚Äôs stock?‚Äù`
